  <h1>Basics of HTML</h1>
  <h3>Common HTML definitions :</h3>
  <h4>HTML :</h4>
  <p>HTML is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It provides the basic building blocks of a website by organizing text, images, links, and multimedia into a readable format for browsers.<br> Without HTML, web pages would have no structure or meaning.</p>

  <h4>Attributes:</h4>
  <p>Attributes provide additional information about an HTML element. They are written inside the opening tag and usually come in name-value pairs like name="value". For example, in <img src="flower.jpg" alt="rose">, the src attribute<br> specifies the image source, and alt gives alternative text.</p>

  <h4>Line Break Example :</h4>
  <p>The body section is where all the visible content of a <br> web page is placed. This includes text, images, videos, links, tables, and more. Whatever is written inside <body> appears on the browser screen when a user opens the webpage.</p>

  <h3>HTML Elements Form the Building Blocks of Web Pages.</h3>
<hr>
<p>
  HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create the 
    structure of web pages and applications. It acts as the foundation of every 
    website you visit, no matter how simple or advanced the design may be. Unlike 
    programming languages, HTML is not concerned with logic or functionality—it 
    focuses purely on the presentation and structure of content. This makes it 
    essential for developers and learners to understand. A web page written in HTML 
    is made up of a series of elements, each defined by tags enclosed within angle 
    brackets. These elements tell the browser how to display the content, whether it 
    should appear as a heading, a paragraph, a table, or an image. By combining 
    different tags, developers can create rich and interactive websites that can be 
    understood by users across the world. The importance of HTML lies in its 
    universality—every browser, from Chrome to Firefox to Safari, interprets it in 
    the same way, ensuring that web pages remain consistent and accessible.
  </p>


 <p>
    One of the most useful features of HTML is its ability to provide meaning through 
    semantic elements. For example, a heading created with the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> 
    tag does more than simply make text appear larger—it tells search engines and 
    screen readers that this text is a primary heading, giving context to both users 
    and machines. Similarly, paragraph tags, list tags, and table tags not only 
    change the visual appearance of text but also describe the purpose of that text. 
    This is especially important for accessibility, as it allows assistive 
    technologies to read and interpret content correctly for people with disabilities. 
    Without these semantic elements, web pages would be harder to navigate and less 
    meaningful. In fact, the reason search engines can rank and categorize websites 
    effectively is because HTML elements provide structure and clarity to content.
  </p>

<p>Attributes add another layer of flexibility and control to HTML. Written inside 
    the opening tag of an element, attributes supply extra instructions that define 
    how the element should behave or appear. For instance, when using the 
    <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag to create a hyperlink, the <code>href</code> 
    attribute is required to specify the destination of the link. Without it, the 
    link would not work. Similarly, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag requires the 
    <code>src</code> attribute to tell the browser where to find the image file, and 
    the <code>alt</code> attribute to provide descriptive text for users who cannot 
    see the image. These small pieces of information play a huge role in ensuring 
    that web pages are functional, accessible, and search engine friendly. Over time, 
    more attributes have been introduced to HTML to improve its versatility, 
    including attributes that control styles, event handling, and multimedia content.</p>

<p> HTML continues to evolve with new versions, the most popular being HTML5, which 
    introduced many modern features such as video and audio embedding without the 
    need for external plugins. It also brought new semantic elements like 
    <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, 
    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, which help 
    developers organize content more logically. These improvements make HTML more 
    powerful and adaptable than ever before. Despite the rise of advanced frameworks 
    and libraries, HTML remains at the core of everything on the web. No matter how 
    complex a website or application becomes, its foundation will always be built 
    using HTML elements, tags, and attributes. Understanding these basics not only 
    helps in building simple web pages but also forms the stepping stone to learning 
    more advanced web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript. Just like the 
    foundation of a building, HTML may often be hidden beneath the surface, but it 
    holds everything together and ensures that the structure of the web remains 
    strong and reliable.</p>
